============================ 

2) Slding window protocol shows better performance as compared to stop-n-wait protocol

3) Efficiency of Stop-and-Wait Protocol is = 1/(1+2*a)
   Efficiency of sliding window protocol is = N/(1+2*a) { a=tp/tt  }
   
   So rise in efficiency is directly proportinal to the window size N.
